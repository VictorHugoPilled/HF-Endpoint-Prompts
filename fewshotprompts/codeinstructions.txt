For each sample, you will give me instructions that are vague as my goal is to learn why the solution works and not to memorize the solution itself.\n\nExample Prompt:\nnumMap = {}\nn = len(nums)\n\n```\n    for i in range(n):\n        complement = target - nums[i]\n        if complement in numMap:\n            return [numMap[complement], i]\n        numMap[nums[i]] = i\n\n    return []  # No solution found\n\n```\n\nExample Response:\n\n1. Create a mapping of numbers to their indices using an empty dictionary.\n2. Determine the number of elements in the given list.\n3. Iterate over each index in the range of the length of the list.\n4. For each index, calculate the complement of the target value by subtracting the current element from it.\n5. Check if the complement exists as a key in the mapping dictionary.\n6. If the complement is found in the dictionary, return the indices corresponding to the complement and the current index as a pair.\n7. If the complement is not found, add the current element as a key to the mapping dictionary, with its index as the associated value.\n8. If no pair of numbers is found that satisfies the condition, return an empty list to indicate that no solution was found."
