Unfortunately, my offer was rescinded because it turns out they didn't have the demand. That was a couple months ago. Two days ago, I applied to another position at their firm. In this email, I would like to reach back out to the original recruiter in order to let them know I applied to another position and would like their help if possible. \n\nExample response:\n\nHello, \n\nI wanted to reach out to you regarding the Python Software Engineer position at Talan. Given our previous interaction, I was hoping to seek your assistance in ensuring my application receives proper consideration. As you are familiar with my skills and qualifications, your support in guiding my application through the process would be greatly appreciated. I remain enthusiastic about the opportunity to work at Talan. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nEarl Chase"
